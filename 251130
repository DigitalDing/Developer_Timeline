Today ran on two tracks: daytime Linux work and nighttime memory training. The recurring theme was capacity building. Although today didnt go as planned 
## Linux Progress

Linux continues to feel more intuitive. Not “easy,” but no longer foreign.

Key points from today:

* Navigation and terminal flow are settling into muscle memory.
* The directory tree, permissions, services, and processes are becoming familiar territory, just needing more depth.
* The initial intimidation is gone; I’m operating with confidence, not hesitation.
* My personal Linux project is clean and intentionally scoped for long-term training.
* I’m noticing early signs of genuine system intuition. Repetition is taking less effort.

## Memory Exercise – Style 1 (Muscle Memory)

Tonight I ran the structured recall protocol. Strict timing, strict sequences, strict resets. No “close enough” allowed.

### Process

* Enter everything once while looking at the reference sheet.
* Start the timer.
* Attempt full recall.
* Any mistake resets the sequence back to item 1.
* Only add a new item once the previous ones feel locked in, not forced.

### Outcome

* Warm-up scales landed at 9:45, which matched earlier pacing predictions almost exactly.
* Natural progression: master item 1, then add item 2, then expand to three.
* Hit the full three-item sequence clean from memory.
* The confidence didn’t come from hype; it came from actually feeling the clicks fall into place.
* This validates the recall system I’m building and shows the curve is predictable.

## Project Notes

I canceled the simulator after the quiz because I didn’t feel I performed well enough to keep pushing. That’s something I’ll come back to with a clear head.

I also built this entire project as a kind of artificial mentorship structure. I’m not sure how I feel about having to rely on something like that, but it’s what I’ve got. And for now, it’s working: it keeps me on track, holds me to routines, and gives me accountability that I don’t have anywhere else.

## Additional Notes

A toothache and headache hit toward the end. A fragment came off a tooth; not sure if it was tartar or something more serious. With the discomfort stacking, I stopped earlier than intended.

Even with that, the work I completed before stopping was meaningful and held its quality.

## Summary

The day didn’t go perfectly, and parts of it weighed on me. But the progress was real.

* Linux intuition continued to deepen.
* The memory-muscle method worked and produced measurable results.
* Recall stability improved.
* I stayed disciplined even when the direction shifted.
* The project structure is doing its job, whether I feel great about it or not.

Momentum remains intact.
