A chronological record of my daily development work, decisions, experiments, and progress. This repository functions as a personal devlog: a place to document what I build, what I fix, and how my technical abilities evolve over time.

The focus is consistency, transparency, and momentum. Each entry captures practical growth as a developer: solving problems, refining systems, exploring tools, and understanding how individual pieces fit together across real projects.

This repo is intentionally simple. Every day gets its own Markdown file inside the logs/ directory, organized by date. Over time, this becomes a narrative of progress, a reference for future work, and a visible timeline of sustained effort.
